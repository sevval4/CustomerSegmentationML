# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using various machine learning algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the "Mall_Customers.csv," which includes customer demographics and spending scores.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, including encoding categorical variables and scaling features.
2. **Modeling**: Different algorithms were implemented and evaluated to determine the best performing model.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: Achieved high accuracy with notable precision and recall scores.
- **Other Models**: Comparative results were provided for SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression, demonstrating their effectiveness in segmentation tasks.

## Visualizations
- Confusion matrices and accuracy plots were created to visualize model performance and improvements over epochs.
